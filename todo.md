- get linting working
- add github action
- add blue color
- print list after each successful add and done command
- print bye! on quit
- add more notes to README; see typescript-overview notes
- To test more:
    - Output.display -> Output.asString (returns String?)
    - printing only happens in readEvalPrintLoop
        - can now test all Output classes
    - create ITodo; program against it
    - could inject ITodo, IPrinter and IInput to main loop
        - can now test main readEvalPrintLoop
